Made in batch. Download the release to view files as it is not a single file.

This was made in batch to get people into coding. Be aware as this is the original and people might make malicous changes. Please make sure to check that the files are from me. (Discord: 5gi#4379) Since it is batch I allow anyone to make changes. Please Explore the code if you like! Batch is a simple programing language so I encourage you to try java or python!
